AirBnB clone 2 Project
Description
The Console

Will help us to:

Create your data model
Manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter
Store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)
In this case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
Update attributes of an object
Destroy an object
